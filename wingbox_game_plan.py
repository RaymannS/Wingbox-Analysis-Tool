# PLAN:
# Use python using Flask or Django to create a web framework 
# (maybe electron for a desktop app?)
#   - Framework used to Customize and Visualize Wingbox
#       - Allows for Geometry and Loads to be input
# Send Geometry/Load inputs into a C++ backend
#   - Do backend computation in C++ for speed and performance
# Send C++ answers back to the web framework
#

# Game Plan:
# 1. Setup Flask/Django project for the frontend
#    - 
# Create forms for wing geometry (span, chord, airfoil) 
#       and loads (distributed/point loads).
# 2. Add a route for rendering the main UI
#    - Use HTML templates (with Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling).
# 3. Implement input validation in the backend
#    - Validate geometry and load inputs from the user.
# 4. Integrate a visualization tool
#    - Use Plotly or Matplotlib for 2D/3D plotting of wing geometry 
#       and load distributions.
# 5. Setup C++ backend for computations
#    - Write C++ functions to handle numerical tasks (e.g., structural 
#       analysis, aerodynamics).
# 6. Define an interface for Python â†” C++ communication
#    - Use Pybind11 for direct calls or Flask to send inputs via REST API.
# 7. Develop a Python function to send data to the C++ backend
#    - Convert user inputs into JSON or binary and transmit to C++.
# 8. Add error handling for communication
#    - Ensure graceful handling of invalid or incomplete C++ results
# 9. Implement C++ functions for wing analysis
#    - Calculate stress, deflections, and other metrics based on input.
# 10. Return results from C++ to Python
#    - Send outputs as JSON or another parsable format.
# 11. Parse C++ results in Python
#    - Extract key data for visualization and display.
# 12. Update the frontend with computed results
#    - Plot results like stress distributions or wing deflections.
# 13. Test the entire pipeline with mock data
#    - Verify communication between frontend, Python, and C++.
# 14. Optimize C++ backend for performance
#    - Profile code and improve efficiency of numerical computations.
# 15. Deploy the Flask/Django app locally
#    - Test on multiple devices for compatibility.
# 16. Optionally package as a desktop app
#    - Use Electron or PyInstaller for distribution.
# 17. Add user feedback for UI improvements
#    - Ensure clarity in inputs and outputs for users.
# 18. Prepare documentation for usage
#    - Include setup instructions and input/output examples.
# 19. Refactor and modularize codebase
#    - Ensure maintainability and scalability.
# 20. Deploy the final app for use
#    - Host the web app or distribute the desktop version.
